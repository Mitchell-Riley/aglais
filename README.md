[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mitchell-Riley/aglais.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mitchell-Riley/aglais)

## About
aglais is an implementation of the [io language](https://github.com/stevedekorte/io) in Go. I started this because as I was fooling around with the original language implementation, I wanted to make my own changes. Here's the problem: it's written in C. I hate C. Go is much nicer. 

However, this is not a direct translation. I am also using this opportunity to learn Go, as well as compiler design.

## Installation
`go get github.com/mitchell-riley/aglais`

## Thanks
* Jonathan Boyett for his inspiring [europa](https://github.com/saysjonathan/europa), a project sharing a similar objective to mine.
* Rob Pike for his ingenious [concurrent lexer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE) design.
